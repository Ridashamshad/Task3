                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in 
                comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have 
                become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around 
                the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, 
                barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its
                purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken 
                has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more 
                healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and 
                saturated fat. Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.

              Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients,
               that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of 
               bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple
               or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, 
               meringues, custards, and pies. The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, 
               sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as 
               baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, 
               candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous 
               substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, 
               nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and 
               decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients,
